        The Komatsu D355 is a heavy-duty crawler pipelayer designed to perform a
        full range of lifting and installation operations in the construction of
        oil and gas pipelines. This special vehicle is characterized by high
        reliability and autonomy in operation, the ability to effectively
        perform its tasks in complete off-road conditions - on flat or
        mountainous, swampy or desert areas, in a wide variety of climatic
        zones.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Komatsu D355 is the most powerful and productive pipelayer in the
        line of pipelayers manufactured by the Japanese company Komatsu. There
        are also models D85C and C, which have a carrying capacity of 41 and 72
        tons, respectively. All these machines are of the same type according to
        the schemes of their crane equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pipelayer is equipped with a Komatsu SA6D 140-2 four-stroke in-line
        six-cylinder diesel engine, liquid-cooled, turbocharged. The working
        volume of the engine is 15.24 liters. The cylinder diameter is 140 mm,
        the piston stroke is 165 mm. The power of this power unit is: full (SAE
        J1995) - 277 kW (377 horsepower), at a nominal speed of 2,000 rpm;
        useful - (ISO 9249 / SAE J1349) - 265 kW (361 horsepower), also at 2,000
        rpm.

        injection, a mechanical fan, an air cleaner, an alternator, a water
        pump, a lubricant pump, a silencer and a fuel pump, a mechanical
        all-mode speed controller. Lubrication is carried out by force, using a
        gear pump; a full-flow filter is installed in the system. The dry air
        cleaner with automatic dust extraction ensures a longer life of the
        filter element, there is a dust indicator to simplify the regular
        maintenance process.
